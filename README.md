<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78345cbb-b406-4404-a358-195a3c49afcf" width="128px"/>

This console program allows you to read Neural Network from the [network.txt](network.txt) file and play the
Tic Tac Toe console Game.

To play the game run:
```shell
.\mvnw.cmd clean package
java -jar .\target\tic-tac-toe-game-1.0.jar
```

The Neural Network ([network.txt](network.txt)) is based on
[Perceptron [1]](https://github.com/NeuroMachinesLab/perceptron) and
trained by [Q-Learning [2]](https://github.com/NeuroMachinesLab/tic-tac-toe-q-learning) data
with the program from [repository [3]](https://github.com/NeuroMachinesLab/tic-tac-toe-network).
